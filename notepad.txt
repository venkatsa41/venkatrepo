Prod1(Primary)-31
Prod2(secondary)-31
Out of 31 nodes
GPFS Manager nodes - 6
GPFS client nodes - 25

Out of 6 Manager nodesn nodes 
NSD nodes ===> All 6 Manager nodes act as NSD nodes who can serve storage to all
Remaining nodes in the cluster in case of any issues accessing storage.
Quorum nodes ====> 3 manager nodes other than gateway nodes are quorum nodes to maintain the cluster up
Out of 3 nodes, quorum set as 2.

Gate way nodes-other than quorum nodes, remaining are gateway nodes which will participate in data replication to secondary site using AFM and Backup and recovery opearations through Avamar.
Filesystem Manager- Any one node will be the file system manager node to manage the file system operations
Cluster Manager- Any one node will be the cluster manager node to manage cluster operations

Primary to Secondary ==> Data replication takes place automatically using GPFS AFM(Asynchronous file management)
For reverse replication- Everytime, We need to do manual configurtion to
change the AFM role reversal which we started recenely (it's not updated
in the DR run book)
Single filesystem in environment and multiple filesets (fileset is a partition of the filesystem)
